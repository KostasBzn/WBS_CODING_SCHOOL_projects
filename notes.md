Goal: Understand the structure and key patterns in the raw data.
Visualizations:
Distribution of order states (bar chart or pie chart).
Time-series plot for orders over time (daily/monthly trends).
Count of products by category/brand (bar chart).


2. Data Cleaning

Goal: Assess the impact of cleaning operations.
Visualizations:
Before-and-after comparison of data (e.g., number of rows/orders).
Visualization of missing values (heatmap or bar chart).
Distribution of cleaned numerical columns (histograms).


3. Discount Analysis

Goal: Explore how discounts are distributed across the dataset.
Visualizations:
Discount Distribution: Histogram or boxplot to show the range and average discount percentages.
Discount by Category/Brand: Bar chart to compare average discounts across categories or brands.
Time Trends: Line chart to show discount trends over time (monthly or weekly).


4. Revenue vs. Discount Impact
File: 05_revenue_vs_discount.ipynb

Goal: Analyze how discounts affect revenue.
Visualizations:
Scatter Plot: Revenue vs. Discount Percentage to show correlation.
Revenue Trends: Line chart for revenue trends with/without discounts.
Heatmap: Show revenue and discount percentage by category or brand.


5. Profitability Analysis
File: 06_profitability_analysis.ipynb

Goal: Measure the financial impact of discounts on profitability.
Visualizations:
Bar Chart: Profit margins across categories, brands, or products with/without discounts.
Pie Chart: Contribution of profitable vs. loss-leading products.
Time-Series Analysis: Line chart showing profitability trends over time.


6. Final Report
File: 07_final_report.ipynb

Goal: Summarize insights and conclusions visually.
Visualizations:
Executive Summary:
Key metrics (revenue, profit, discount percentage) in a dashboard-style layout.
Infographics: Use combined charts to convey:
Revenue vs. Discount patterns.
Profitability analysis.
Category/brand performance.
Decision Matrix: Highlight products/categories where discounts are beneficial vs. detrimental.


Key Visualization Tools:
Matplotlib/Seaborn: For detailed, customizable charts.
Plotly: For interactive visualizations (if needed).
Pandas Built-in Plots: Quick, simple visualizations for initial analysis.


General Best Practices for Visualizations:
Use Titles and Labels: Clearly label axes and add titles to all charts.
Focus on Clarity: Avoid overloading charts with excessive details.
Consistency: Use consistent colors and chart types to compare similar metrics.
Highlight Key Insights: Use annotations, colors, or markers to emphasize important points.
Visualizations will not only enhance your understanding during analysis but also make your findings more compelling in the final report.
