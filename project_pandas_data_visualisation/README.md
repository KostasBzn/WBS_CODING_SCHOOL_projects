# Project WBS Data Science Bootcamp - Data Storytelling with Pandas and Matplotlib

This repository contains the data, code, and analysis for the second project of the WBS Coding School Data Science Bootcamp. The goal of this project is to analyze sales data and determine whether discounts impact sales performance and profitability.

## ðŸ“– **Project Purpose**
The project aims to answer the following key questions:
- Do discounts drive revenue growth?
- Are discounts profitable or do they lead to losses?
- How does the sales performance compare for discounted vs. non-discounted products?

## ðŸ›  **Workflow**
1. **Exploration**: 
   - Loaded and examined the dataset for structure and quality.
   - Identified key columns, such as `brand`, `revenue`, `discount`, and `percentage_discount`.

2. **Aggregation**: 
   - Grouped data by relevant categories (e.g., brand, discount status) for analysis.
   - Calculated metrics such as total revenue, discount percentages, and sell ratios.

3. **Cleaning and Quality Checks**:
   - Removed or addressed missing and inconsistent data points.
   - Validated calculations for accuracy.

4. **Visualization**:
   - Created plots (line plots, bar plots, etc.) to compare revenue trends, sell ratios, and discount impacts.

## ðŸ§° **Tools Used**
- **Python Libraries**:
  - `pandas`: For data manipulation and aggregation.
  - `matplotlib` and `seaborn`: For creating data visualizations.
- Jupyter Notebook: For interactive coding and visualization.

## ðŸ”‘ **Key Insights**
- Discounts do not consistently lead to higher revenue.
- The analysis is inconclusive due to a lack of cost data, which limits our understanding of profitability.
- Trends indicate that the effectiveness of discounts varies by brand and product type.
